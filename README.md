<h1 align="center">Hi <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ABSphreak/ABSphreak/master/gifs/Hi.gif" width="30px">, I'm Someet</h1>

I am currently a student, just started my journey in Open-Source. I'm learing Machine Learning, applying it and contributing. Currently I'm learning about ML models, LLMs and Vision models. I have worked specifically on Onject detection models and finetuning for specific models.
Next I have started learning about Vision-Language models ( VLM ). Let's see what projects I can create in it.
